## How to use

- Go to https://tenhou.net/3/
- Click the gear icon on the top right
- Click right arrow button until you get to the SE settings page
- Paste in one of the following URLs:
[lite version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janbo21/senba-voice-pack/main/lite.json)
or 
[full version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janbo21/senba-voice-pack/main/full.json)

The lite version only changes the sound effects that are voiced by default plus the SE at the start of the game and when a yakuman happens. 

The full version changes all sound effects, use with caution.
